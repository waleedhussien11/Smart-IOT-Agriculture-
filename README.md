# Smart Agriculture Project

## Overview

The Smart Agriculture Project integrates various sensors and control mechanisms to monitor and manage farm conditions remotely. It leverages IoT technologies for real-time data collection, storage, and analysis, enhancing decision-making processes in agriculture.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration:**
  - DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  - Flame Sensor
  - Rain Sensor
  - Soil Moisture Sensor

- **Control Mechanisms:**
  - Mobile Application for Farm Control
  - Servo Motor for Door Control

- **Cloud Integration:**
  - Firebase for Data Storage and Real-time Updates
  - AWS Cloud Services for Data Analysis and Decision Making

## Components

### Hardware

- Arduino: Microcontroller platform for sensor interfacing and control.
- NodeMCU: IoT development board for wireless communication and data upload.
- DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
- Flame Sensor: Detects presence of flames or fire.
- Rain Sensor: Detects rain or moisture.
- Soil Moisture Sensor: Monitors soil moisture levels.
- Servo Motor: Controls physical mechanisms like doors or gates.

### Software

- Firebase: Cloud database for storing sensor data and enabling real-time updates.
- AWS Cloud Services: Provides cloud-based data analysis and decision-making capabilities.
- Arduino IDE: Development environment for programming Arduino and NodeMCU.
- Mobile App: Allows users to monitor farm conditions and control devices remotely (Specify platform).

## Setup Instructions

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect Sensors:**
   - Attach each sensor to the appropriate digital or analog pins on the Arduino or NodeMCU.
   - Ensure proper wiring and power supply for reliable sensor operation.

2. **Servo Motor Setup:**
   - Connect the servo motor to the designated pins on the Arduino or NodeMCU.
   - Program the microcontroller to control the servo motor based on input from the mobile app or sensor readings.

### Software Setup

1. **Arduino Sketch:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino or NodeMCU board.
   - Modify the sketch to include specific sensor libraries and configurations.

2. **Firebase Integration:**
   - Set up a Firebase account and create a new project.
   - Configure your Arduino or NodeMCU to send sensor data to Firebase using Firebase APIs or libraries.

3. **AWS Cloud Services:**
   - Create an AWS account and set up necessary services such as AWS IoT, Lambda, or S3 for data analysis and storage.
   - Configure your system to send collected data to AWS for further analysis and decision making.

4. **Mobile Application:**
   - Install the mobile application on your smartphone or tablet 
   - Configure the app to connect to Firebase and control farm devices remotely.

## Usage

Once set up, the Smart Agriculture Project allows users to:
- Monitor real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, flame, rain, soil moisture).
- Control farm devices (servo motor-operated doors) remotely via the mobile application.
- Analyze historical data stored on Firebase and AWS for making informed decisions about farm management.
